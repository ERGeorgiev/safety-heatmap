# Proposed Features

Proposed features to discuss further in the future.

## Account Reports

Users have accounts. When a report is submitted, it is saved to the user's account for later viewing or editing.

## Public User Reports

The map displays user-submitted reports in the area as well as the heatmap, so any user can see other details on the report and be better informed. This can be behind a toggle.

## Report Descriptions

Descriptions can be added to reports.

**Consideration**: Unfiltered Descriptions
Allowing users to add free-text description could spell trouble. Avoiding that would mean committing resources to scanning and filtering such input.
To solve that, users can instead pick from preset words or sentences.

## Safety Notification

Given a user account and the knowledge of their location, when there is a spike of reports is submitted in their region, the user can be made aware with a notification or an email.

## Gender-Adjusted Heatmap

The heatmap can be adjusted to display reports based on gender.

## Report Pictures

As part of a report's description, a user can submit pictures to show what was unsafe.
