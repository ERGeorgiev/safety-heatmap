# Consideration: Targeting

The map is split in cells as explained in [map-chunking.md](map-chunking.md). While the cells may be bigger than the average house, preventing targeting of most individuals, this may not apply to individuals that have large houses. As such, we will provide an email that users can use to contact us to have such data manually deleted.
